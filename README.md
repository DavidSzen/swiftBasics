# swiftBasics
A Swift Playground covering basics for code newbies.

## To use 

**Note: You need XCode to use this. Download it for free from the app Store on macOS: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12* As of Sept 2017, XCode is about 5Gb and almost 11Gb after unzipping it*

Hit the download button on the top, and select download as .zip. Open the zip file to get a folder containing the Playground and supporting files. 

*or*

Go to the file Contents.Swift and copy/paste directly into an open Playground.

(Open in Desktop is for if you have Github Desktop. You probably don't, at this point.)
